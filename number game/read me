# Random Numbers Games

## Overview
The `game2.py` file contains two exciting random numbers games:
1. **Guessing Game**: A game where the player guesses a randomly generated number.
2. **Blackjack**: A simplified version of the classic card game where the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

## Games Description

### 1. Guessing Game
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 20.
- The player has to guess the number.
- Feedback is provided for each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- The game tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

### 2. Blackjack
- The player is dealt two random cards (numbers between 1 and 11).
- The player can choose to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (keep their current total).
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- If the player exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.
- The dealer also plays, and the winner is determined based on who is closer to 21.

## How to Play
1. Run the `game2.py` file:
   ```bash
   python number game/game2.py
   ```
2. Choose a game by entering the corresponding number (1 for Guessing Game, 2 for Blackjack).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the selected game.
4. After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again.
