# Python Learning Projects

This repository houses small Python projects I used to learn the language. Each project focuses on different fundamental concepts and practical applications in Python, including:

- **GUI Applications:** Projects using Tkinter, such as a simple calculator and a to-do list app, to practice building graphical user interfaces.
- **Basic Algorithms:** Scripts that demonstrate sorting, searching, and other core programming techniques.
- **File Handling:** Examples of reading from and writing to files in Python.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Projects that use classes and objects to model real-world scenarios.
- **Date and Time Handling:** Code that works with Python's `datetime` module to manage dates and times.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Navigate to the project folder you want to try.
4. Run the Python script using:
   ```
   python filename.py
   ```
   (Replace `filename.py` with the script you want to run.)

## Projects Included

- `calc_GUI.py`: A simple calculator with a graphical interface.
- `To-Do-list.py`: A basic to-do list application with task management features.
- Additional scripts demonstrating various Python concepts.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these projects as learning tools!
